# README

## This pass is the first pass designed by myself

## Although it is named as LiveVariableInBranch, it can support the live variable analysis in loop

## TO BE Improved:

   - The basic block of instruction can be obtained directly by LLVM interface.
      - SingleBasicBlockLivenessInfo can be omitted by changing the granularity from basic block to instruction

   - BitVector is available in LLVM 10
      - BitVectorMap can be simplified

## Improved version: refer to pass/LiveVariableInLoop
